# Link-Verifier
PROJECT, Small: An application/module for links validity verification in .md format files

This module will take a Markdown(.md) file as argument and return its links in a object list.
Using the following command in the terminal, ' "npm run cli" + "PATH" ', if "PATH" is a valid path for the aimed file, the result will be returned.
Using an additional argument after path, "valida", the status of that url link will also be returned. Example: " npm run cli ../dir/file.md valida "

You might run "npm run" in your terminal to list commands in order to test this module, if you wish.
